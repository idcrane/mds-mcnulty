### Heart Disease Risk

For in-depth description of project, see [here](https://www.idcrane.com/blog/2014/11/02/risk-of-heart-disease/)

Everything relating to the analysis is in the IPython notebook. The notebook uses data in a remote MySQL database, but you can get the [original data](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/nhis_2013_data_release.htm) (under Sample Adult). 

The 'heart_disease_d3.html' visualization is [online](https://www.idcrane.com/resources/heart_disease_d3.html).
